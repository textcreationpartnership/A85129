            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And in this Anſwer he is diſcovered, and proved to be one that is chief in the ſervice of the old Dragon: who pretends in his Book to diſcover the myſtery of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as he calls them, and to lay open a dangerous deſign: who is found out, that whilſt he hath been pretending to be chief in diſcovering a Plot, or Antichriſts miſterious actings, is found himſelf to be the chief plotter, by a Satanical ſpirit diſguiſed, and in the transformings of Antichriſt, deep in the myſtery which he pretended to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcover; but is here apprehended and taken, and alſo encountered withal: as the wiſe-hearted, in the reading with a pure underſtanding may ſee: and ſo this may prove to be a means of a greater downfal of Antichriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and for the furthering of the truth, and ſetting up of purity in its right place; and by this, Truth and Error may be clearly known aſunder: that deceit may thereby be forſaken, and Truth embraced, and received, as it is in Life and Power, in the Lord Jeſus, who hath ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall know the Truth, and the Truth ſhall make you free.

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Mittimus</hi> begins thus, as followeth, and the anſwer unto it.</p>
            <p>To the Keeper of the Goal for the County of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> 1655.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Foraſmuch as</hi> Thomas Goodaire <hi>the</hi> 25. <hi>of this inſtant</hi> March <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords day came into the Pariſh Church of</hi> Kederminſter.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, no Church it is, but a Synagogue of Satan which brings ſorth that monſter perſecution, and caſts into priſon for ſpeaking the truth; but it is written, <hi>Fear none of thoſe things which thou ſhalt ſuffer; behold, the Devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ye may be tryed, and ye ſhall have tribulation ten dayes: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a Crown of life,</hi> as it is written <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10. The true Church of Chriſt never perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any; but your Pariſh Church (as you call it) hath brought ſorth that monſter, therefore a harlot, and not the ſpouſe, be you aſhamed thereof. The true Church is in God, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. and 1. and doth not periſh: but yours is out of God and ſo periſhing. Chriſt is the head of his body the Church: <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.22.23. but not of a Steeple-houſe; you have told a lye to call that a Church, and are found perſecuters alſo, and ſo not of Chriſts Church: it were not of a perſecuting nature; but ſuch as followed him the Head, were of that body which were perſecuted; <hi>John</hi> 15.18, 19, 20, 21. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. but you have cleared your ſelves o be none of that Body, nor Church, that perſecute his, and ſhut up in priſon, as you have done.</p>

            <p>Mittimus. <hi>And there misbehaved himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Speaking the truth is no misbehaviour, and he ſpoke the truth: but misbehaviour he doth deny, and therefore that accuſation is falſe, and you are taken venting, and hath vented another lye, and read who lyers are of, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. and you that are ſuch lyers of the innocent, and bends your tongues like your bowes for lyes, to cauſe them thereby to ſuffer impriſonment: be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſhamed for ever, and read your reward that are ſuch lyars <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. &amp;c. But to be ſhort, I ſhall ſet down the <hi>Mittimus</hi> as it is <hi>verbatim:</hi> and let the wiſe-hearted ſee if there be any breach of a known Law; but only filled with lyes, and thereby doth not act the part of Juſtice, Righteouſneſs, nor Chriſtianity; and let <hi>Richard Baxter</hi> and his partakers be aſhamed of what they have done; and wo be unto ſuch an Antichriſtian Miniſter, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian perſecuting Miniſtry.</p>

            <p>The world loves his own, and the world delights in its own, the world ſpeaketh to the world, and the world hears that which is ſpoken from the earthly heart, reacheth the deaf eare, and no farther, that which is comprehended by the dark minde that is ſpoken forth by the deceitful Tongue, that feeds the deceit that lodgeth in the hearers, ſo one darkneſs upholds another, and the ſame deceit upholds its own in both ſpeaker and hearer; ſo in both Writer and Reader, yea all that write and ſpeak that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not from the life, but from the death, being in the ſtate of death, is but death ſpeaking to death, whereby Serpents are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, or the ſeed of the Serpent is increaſed.</p>
            <p>Now they that are of God, heares Gods word, and they that hear not his word are not of God; for the natural man perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the things of the ſpirit of God, for they are ſpiritually diſcerned by the ſpiritual man that judgeth all things, though no man can judge him who is a Child of the day, and dwelleth in the light, and hath no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, out of which the Children of the day are delivered, and can witneſs the darkneſs paſt, and the true light now ſhining in them; but all thoſe who ſay they have fellowſhip with light, and walk in darkneſs, are lyers, and all lyers are ſhut out of the Kingdom, and are eſtranged from God, who is altogether pure, ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>After <hi>Edmund Skipp</hi> had thrown off his Tithes, and convinced of much more, which he was waiting to throw off too, he then told me not long before he left us, that he had not faith to carry him through, neither could he beleive; but he was confident, that the Devil would ſteal all that he had from him again, the which is now too true.</p>

Thou ſayeſt, that we eſteem, The more our hearts are brought off the dealings of God, and prayer, and ſpiritual exerciſes, the more pure and perfect: the which thou knoweſt to be a lie, witneſs thy own words, after the meeting at <hi>Clifton,</hi> where thou ſayſt, thou ſaw ſuch a ſpirit of prayer as thou never had ſeen before, to which thoſe that were there, can yet teſtifie, and we witneſs growth in grace and knowledge, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. and walk from grace to grace, leaving the firſt principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. forgetting thoſe things which are behind, we preſſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; for man in his own wiſdom cannot finde out the Lord, who is a ſpirit, <hi>John</hi> 4.24. and regardeth not the wiſe in heart, <hi>Job</hi> 37.23.24. therefore if any man will be wiſe, let him become a fool, that ſo he may be found in the wiſdom that is from above, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.17.</p>
               <p>Next thou ſayes, that we deſire the periſhing of the former wayes of God: this is another of thy lies; for all the wayes of the Lord are righteous, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.17. ſo in page 18.

               <p>Oh my friends, my friends, the hour is not only comming, but now is witneſſed in me, that the dead ſhall: hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.25. and the voice of the true Dove is heard in our Land, to wit, this earthly Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle that is made the Temple of the living God, who is now ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling his promiſes in us, that walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit, even in us is the Lord, eſtabliſhing his new and everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Covenant, even the ſure and certain mercies of <hi>David,</hi> which is by the life of Ieſus Chriſt in us fulfilled and witneſſed, whereby we have fellowſhip with the Father, and one in meaſure brought to live in him, and he in us, where we have joy and reſt, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal peace, which paſſeth all underſtanding, and all the worlds comprehenſion, where all the Children of the light meet, and ſee face to face; for the Lord hath brought again, <hi>Sion</hi> who is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the perfection of beauty, out of the which, God now ſhineth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.2. and is become our glory, and we his, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.13.
